# gerbparse

GerbParse is a simple gerber parser and execution library. The library only supports the basic instructions of the Gerber File Specification. However, it is still a robust library that can handle a variety of different instructions.

The main purpose of this library was to read printed circuit board files and produce a list of shapes for use in the GBR2STL project. The library supports all the common instructions used in printed circuit board files. However, it does not support curved lines.
